I made this for a friend who started hosting in home parties for 'Pure Romance' selling sex toys and adult entertainment.

First page is for listing products and prices.

Secod page is the 'Customer List' from which the invoices will self populate.

Third page is the 'Party Invoice' or master invoice, was used by the sales person to place the actual order.

Rest of the pages are the individual invoices for the attendees of the party.
