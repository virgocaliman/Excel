The appspot is something that I put together for a gaming community which allowed the organizers (or senior officers) to have a formal roster with logistical tracking.  They had one file for each 'branch' (the name of which was setup on the last page in the yellow box) which would contain multiple 'squads' (as designated on the 2nd page in the yellow boxes).

The bulk of their data was on the first page (Manage Members) and the forth page (Transfer's & Removals), the other pages draw information from first page and break it down for easier viewing as well as to assist the Commander of each branch to quickly fill out their monthly reports as to how the branch had grown or shrunk.  The last page was used to easily copy into their website (with additional HTML code included) for reference purposes by the general membership.
